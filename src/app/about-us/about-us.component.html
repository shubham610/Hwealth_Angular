            About us</h1>
        <p>We are a general insurance company. Now, before those words conjure images of beige walls and bleak souls in
            your head, let us tell you we are vibrant and vivacious, and were founded to break that drab mould you were
            about to cast us in.

            We started in 2016 as India’s first digital insurer, and are currently the fastest growing insurance company
            in the country. In a span of three years we have revved up insurance with technology and given it a snazzy
            makeover—we’ve taken it online, wiped out much of the paperwork associated with it, created products that
            are a cut above the ho-hum, and sold them to over 50 million unique customers.

            All this jazzing up has been brought about by our team that is obsessed with making insurance effortless.
            This team has grown from a small huddle of 6 when we started, to a clan of more than 400 now. And this
            eclectic clan—comprising everyone from coders who double up as comics to finance whizzes who slay at
            karaokes—is responsible for other great feats too.</p>

            class="my-4">

        <p>Like winning us incredible partners. In the past few years, we have partnered with some of the best
            businesses in the digital world. Ola, redBus, Amazon and OYO are some of the popular partners alongside whom
            we’ve launched innovative products like trip insurance, electronics cover and hotel-stay insurance. These
            bite-sized product offerings have received much love from our customers and even ushered in awards.</p>

        <p>Our micro-insurance product—Ola Trip Insurance, which insures cab passengers, was awarded the Golden Peacock
            Innovative Product last year;

            Financial Express chose us as the winner in their Insurance and Savings category the same year; LinkedIn’s
            list of Top Startups features us regularly and now as we feel that we’ve bragged enough, let’s move on.

            We’re a driven team working towards improving every aspect of insurance. Be it pricing, purchase, or
            claims—we’re amping it up with data and tech. We offer customised prices, instant policy, super-quick claim
            settlements, and are ceaselessly pushing forward to make insurance as friendly as a smile. Besides our
            collective passion for customer convenience, we’re propelled by the love and support of our customers and
            investors. Speaking of investors—allow us to indulge in a little name-dropping—we’re backed by bigwigs like
            Amazon, Accel Partners, Catamaran Ventures, Elevation Capital, RPS Ventures, and Mr. Binny Bansal.

            Now that you know us a little better, explore our website, products and maybe get yourself a new age
            insurance.</p>
